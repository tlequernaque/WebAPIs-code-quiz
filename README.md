# WebAPIs-code-quiz

## Description
This webpage JavaScript code was incomplete and the generate password button was not working. New code was added, to jascript, that included making a user choose the lenght of the password. The user can also choose whether they want numbers, special characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase characters. All passwords are generated at random accordingly to what character choices the user wants included. After the choices are made the password will be displayed on the screen.
